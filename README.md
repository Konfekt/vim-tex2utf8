This Vim plug-in provides the two commands `:Latex2UTF8` and `:UTF8ToLatex`
that operate on a range (by default the whole buffer) and convert between
`LaTeX` commands and `UTF-8` characters.

# Credits

The list of pairs between which to convert originated from Jos van den Oever's [unilatex.vim](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=284).
